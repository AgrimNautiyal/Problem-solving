normalisation
relations
transactions 


throw and throws with super and subclass constraints
static block normal block and nested classes
java visbility (public private etc)
this constructor
method overloading with type promotion
abstract classes and interfaces
overloading vs overriding (static child with static parent methods, and method hiding vs normal cases)
super key word (inheritance) - in constructors and variables
Collection classes in Java and their properties
why multiple inheritance is not supported in Java (due to ambiguity during runtime polymorphism)
aggregation, composition, association
final methods
default methods
Java 8 and Java 9 features - (default and static methods in interface, private methods in interface)
can we implement default and static methods in child class - (No, both have to be static methods, and then Parent class works)
can we implement private methods in child class - No (compile time error)
checked(compile time), unchecked exceptions(run-time) and error examples
