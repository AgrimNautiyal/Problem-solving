List of roadblock questions : 

1)pythagorean triplets
url : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pythagorean-triplet/0
learning outcomes and bonus goals :
.implement custom search function instead of "in" [binary search]
.implement custom sort function instead of sorted [quick/merge]
.implement hashmaps to reduce redundancies for A[i] > 1000

above modifications should hit the ideal benchmark runtime


2)intersection of y linked lists 
learning outcomes :

.use set() to search instead of list for "in" operator, o(1) complxty


3)binary tree to dll : 
learning outcomes:

.it's all pointers, work your code in modules, and test repeatedly after each module so that you can move on to the next module with confidence and zone down any error to a specific module during debugging

4)no of pairs pow(x,y) > pow(y, x):
remaining : try an optimal solution for the problem
(mlogm + nlogn)

5)convert bin tree to DLL/CDLL:
remaining : try to find a way to create your DLL/CDLL in the recursive call only
